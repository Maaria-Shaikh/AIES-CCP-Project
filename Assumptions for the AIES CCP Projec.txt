Assumptions for the AIES CCP Project:

1. The input dataset used for training and testing the AI model is preprocessed, clean, and free of missing or corrupted data.
2. The classes in the dataset (e.g., spam and non-spam emails) are reasonably balanced to ensure model performance.
3. The computing environment has Python 3.8 or higher installed along with all required libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
4. The AI model training and evaluation are performed on a machine with sufficient RAM and processing power to handle the dataset efficiently.
5. The user will provide inputs in the expected format without introducing malformed or invalid data.
6. Internet connectivity is available during the setup phase to download necessary libraries and dependencies.
7. The video explanation uploaded on YouTube is accessible and clearly demonstrates the project implementation and results.
8. The project report includes all necessary details on algorithms, justifications, and performance metrics as required by the CCP guidelines.
9. The dataset labels are correct. 
10. All messages are in English. 
11. Stopwords do not provide distinguishing power and are removed. 
12. Features (words) are independent given the class â€” a key assumption of Naive Bayes.
